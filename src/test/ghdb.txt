Aliases can be declared in bash files. These aliases will\r\nlast as long as our shell session is present.\r\n\r\nTo create an alias insert the following command in to .bashrc file\r\n\r\n*alias alias_name=\"command_to_run\"*\r\n\r\nApache server comes with a default offline .bashrc file which can be\r\nexploited further if the alias commands are found.\r\n\r\n*Remediation:*\r\n\r\n1. Disable Directory listing in the server.\r\n2. Remove .bashrc files in the production server or remove the Read / Write\r\npermission of the file through internet.\r\n\r\n*Author: *Melvin Varkey"

    "summary": "Observing the web cracker in the wild, one feels like they are watching a bear. Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:\"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.\"The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:\"nph-proxy.cgi\" \"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy\"More results can be obtained by admitting the \"inurl:nph-proxy.cgi\" constraint, but much more trash is generated as well."

Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the \"pathext\" variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the \"view\" variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/&view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module."

This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour.

It can currently: create, rename and delete folders; create, upload, rename, download and delete files; edit text files; view image files; sort files by name, size, permissions and last modification date both ascending and descending; communicate in more languages. This search finds those \"public\" versions of PHPFM. An attacker can use them to manage his own files (phpshell anyone ?).PS: thanks to j0hnny for the public access angle :)"
